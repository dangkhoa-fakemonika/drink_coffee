## 1. Description ☕
A small website application that I made. You can visit it at :
https://drink-coffee.onrender.com/

## 2. Features & Concepts ☕

### Concept ☕
The main concept of this website is there is a cup of coffee ☕ you can drink every day.
The cup will refill itself at 7AM local time each day, and you can only drink one cup per day (a healthy amount!).

I make this with the intention of adding a new feature, whether big or small, to this every week or so, as a small exercise for myself.

### Feature ☕
+ Added flavor texts for coffee ☕ states (refilled, after drinking, soon to be filled, leaving it un-drank).
+ New features coming soon.

## 3. Licenses ☕
The filled cup belongs to `Twemoji 15.0.3` (14 August 2024).
The empty cup is made by me. The website is deployed using `render.com`. I don't make money out of this.


Thank you for reading this! Have a good cup of coffee! ☕
