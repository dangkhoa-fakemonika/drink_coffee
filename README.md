## 1. Description ☕
A small website application that I made. You can visit it at :
https://drink-coffee.onrender.com/

## 2. Features & Concepts ☕

### Concept ☕
The main concept of this website is there is a cup of coffee ☕ you can drink every day.
The cup will refill itself each day, and you can only drink one cup per day (a healthy amount!).

I make this with the intention of adding a new feature, whether big or small, to this every week or so, as a small exercise for myself.

### Features ☕
- The first time you visit the page every day, you will get a cup of coffee ☕ on the screen.
- You can drink the coffee ☕ by clicking/tapping on it.
Every drink will take a sip out of the coffee ☕. A cup will take 10 sips to finished.
- The state of the cup will be unchanged throughout the day.
You can take some sips and come back for another time. No one will take your coffee ☕.
- You can only get one cup per day, and the coffee ☕ will be available for refilling on 7 AM local time.
- Drinking or tapping on the empty cup will show flavor texts, which is a feature I deemed as crucial.

### Patch Notes ☕
- **Nov 14, 2024**
  + Creation of coffee ☕ page
- **Nov 15, 2024**
  + Added flavor texts for coffee ☕ states (refilled, after drinking, soon to be filled, leaving it un-drank).
  + Added README.md for this. I want to share my thoughts somewhere.
- **Nov 22, 2024**
  + Added coffee ☕ filling animation on first visit.
  + The coffee☕ can be drink in multiple sips.
  + MORE extra flavor texts is added, including: random drinking texts, progress and time based texts, and others.
  + The empty cups are now cleaned, because you are a tidy person.

+ More features coming soon.

## 3. Licenses ☕
The filled cup belongs to `Twemoji 15.0.3` (14 August 2024).
The empty cup is made by me. The website is deployed using `render.com`. I don't make money out of this.

Thank you for reading this! Have a good cup of coffee! ☕
