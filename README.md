## 1. Description ☕
A small website application that I made. You can visit it at :
https://drink-coffee.onrender.com/

## 2. Features & Concepts ☕

### Concept ☕
The main concept of this website is there is a cup of coffee ☕ you can drink every day.
The cup will refill itself at 7AM local time each day, and you can only drink one cup per day (a healthy amount!).

I make this with the intention of adding a new feature, whether big or small, to this every week or so, as a small exercise for myself.

### Features ☕
- **Nov 15, 2024**
  + Added flavor texts for coffee ☕ states (refilled, after drinking, soon to be filled, leaving it un-drank).
  + Added README.md for this. I want to share my thoughts somewhere.
- **Nov 22, 2024**
  + Added Coffee filling animation on first visit.
  + The coffee can be drink in multiple sips.
  + MORE extra flavor texts is added, including: random drinking texts, progress and time based texts, and others.
  + The empty cups are now cleaned, because you are a tidy person.

+ More features coming soon.

## 3. Licenses ☕
The filled cup belongs to `Twemoji 15.0.3` (14 August 2024).
The empty cup is made by me. The website is deployed using `render.com`. I don't make money out of this.
